Sketching the UI out a bit:
1. Global page - if you have no me data stored. Don't store anything until you actually persist information
	a. Search through spirits
	b. On a spirit, see others by the same distillery
	c. On a spirit, see similars, etc. These will need new services
2. Me page (requires login, but we always do that)
	a. My spirits
	b. .... 
3. Spirit page shows a card of the spirit


Current state:
Have SPA v0.1 model working with *Application tree. What are scenarios that are or not supported with it??
Using require to delay-load referenced files
Data shape for global/ calls 


Next steps:
Think through local vs loaded app.ts and index.html
Use React - render annoyances will go away with ReactDOM.Render()
Can I do a test project
Bundle css. Can I use LESS or SASS?
Add more layers (ex: My, SpiritPage)
Build caches over the top of them using the same interfaces
Think about what the Opinion entries might look like
What does the my/ set of calls look like?
Tasting experience will likely need a fancy native/canvas implementation? Touch focused and requires understanding, maybe a "fixed total points" concept?
Bundle the js files
