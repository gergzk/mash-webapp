x  Create a DistilleryDatabase, like the SpiritDatabase
Build caches over the top of them using the same interfaces
Think about what the Opinion entries might look like
See if you can add unit tests to the project
Start sketching out the UI a bit:
1. Global page - if you have no me data stored. Don't store anything until you actually persist information
	a. Search through spirits
	b. On a spirit, see others by the same distillery
	c. On a spirit, see similars, etc. These will need new services
2. Me page (requires login, but we always do that)
	a. My spirits
	b. .... 
3. Spirit page shows a card of the spirit


Longer term, get React together. React will make great card bases, etc. 
Tasting experience will likely need a fancy native/canvas implementation? Touch focused and requires understanding, maybe a "fixed total points" concept?

Have SPA v0.1 model working with *Application tree. What are scenarios that are or not supported with it??


Think through local vs loaded app.ts and index.html
Use React - render annoyances will go away with ReactDOM.Render()
Can I do a test project
Add more layers (ex: My, SpiritPage)
